# 💻 Human-in-the-Loop Power App for Software Asset Management (SAM)

Welcome to the brain of the **Software Asset Management (SAM)** AI advisor project — powered by a human-in-the-loop Power App that thinks smart but still checks with you (because even AI needs a buddy sometimes). 👩‍💻🤖
This repository contains designs, logic, and supporting code/scripts related to PowerApps, Copilot Studio, and Generative AI workflows — all neatly woven together to support a SAM team in making better software decisions.
## 🧠 What's Inside?

- 🔍 A **click-through homepage** interface to navigate catalogs
- 📚 A **catalog viewer** with filtering, editing, and searching
- 🛠️ Python scripts (coming soon) to support AI-assisted GenAI pipelines for analysis and data prep
- 💬 Copilot Studio bot integrations in future versions to help you chat with your software catalog like it's 2025 (because it is)
